ABOUT THE EXECUTABLE:

KU Loader is only supported on Linux distros provided that there exists libqt5widgets5 package.
If the package doesn't exist then it as to be manually downloaded before running the executable.
So, we have created a file "run.sh" which checks whether the package is installed in your computer,
if it exists then the program will run; if it downot exists, it will first download the package and then 
run the program.

Steps:

1) Allow run.sh to run as a program.

2) In terminal enter the directory which consists the run.sh file and run this command:
	./run.sh
